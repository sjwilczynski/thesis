abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},

abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used in data processing and dimensionality reduction. However, PCA suffers from the fact that each principal component is a linear combination of all the original variables, thus it is often difficult to interpret the results. We introduce a new method called sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) using the lasso (elastic net) to produce modified principal components with sparse loadings. We first show that PCA can be formulated as a regression-type optimization problem; sparse loadings are then obtained by imposing the lasso (elastic net) constraint on the regression coefficients. Efficient algorithms are proposed to fit our SPCA models for both regular multivariate data and gene expression arrays. We also give a new formula to compute the total variance of modified principal components. As illustrations, SPCA is applied to real and simulated data with encouraging results.},

abstract = {OAPA In many microarray studies, classifiers have been constructed based on gene signatures to predict clinical outcomes for various cancer sufferers. However, signatures originating from different studies often suffer from poor robustness when used in the classification of datasets independent from which they were generated from. In this paper, we present an unsupervised feature learning framework by integrating a principal component analysis algorithm and autoencoder neural network to identify different characteristics from gene expression profiles. As the foundation for the obtained features, an ensemble classifier based on the AdaBoost algorithm (PCA-AE-Ada) was constructed to predict clinical outcomes in breast cancer. During the experiments, we established an additional classifier with the same classifier learning strategy (PCA-Ada) in order to perform as a baseline to the proposed method, where the only difference is the training inputs. The AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) index, MCC (Matthews correlation coefficient) index, ACC (accuracy), and other evaluation parameters of the proposed method were tested on several independent breast cancer datasets and compared with representative gene signature-based algorithms including the baseline method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method using deep learning techniques performs better than others.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION When running experiments that involve multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations. RESULTS We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably. AVAILABILITY Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

abstract = {In cancer research there is a large need to automate parts of the process of diagnosis, this is mainly to reduce cost, make it faster and more accurate. Gene expression data of tumor samples is known to contain much information about the disease and with that information that can help with diagnosing and even curing the patient. Datamining methods are an obvious candidate to aid in this automation and therefore have been deployed on gene expression data in a number of research papers. However, all these researchers face the same problem, the limited amount of samples and the large number of features. Due to the many genes in the human genome and the only few tumor samples that have been processed for their gene expression data, the data set has much more features than there are samples. This makes any type of data analysis hard due to easy overfitting on data with these properties. Thusly, there is a need for a way of effectively reducing the dimensionality of the samples, without removing the information of interest, to enable more effective data analysis of the reduced set. In this thesis, I propose a framework that is capable of reducing the dimensionality of gene expression samples for case-specific purposes. I explore multiple types of dimensionality reduction from basic statistical ones to novel deep learning algorithms. This research concludes with suggesting a combination of multiple linear prediction algorithms for feature selection in a case-specific fashion. With these types of algorithms some problems exist with the selections stability and robustness, I designed a framework aimed at improving these properties of the resulting selection. The framework combines multiple of these algorithms with cross-folding to end up with a sufficiently stable set of features that can be used for further analysis. Apart from this main result, the framework produces metrics that indicate the quality of the selection and it does additional genetic analysis and plotting relevant for field experts. Besides proposing and arguing the setup and validity of this framework, the implemented framework is tested on several medically relevant use cases and the results of these tests are presented and analyzed in this thesis as well. These results show the effectiveness of the framework on certain use-cases and the limits of the gene expression data. They prove that the framework is a solution to the proposed problem and show that the framework could add value for medical professionals during their daily practices.},

abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

Recently, several large-scale studies have shed light on this problem through analysis of gene expression profiles to identify markers correlated with metastasis. Here, we apply a protein-network-based approach that identifies markers not as individual genes but as subnetworks extracted from protein interaction databases. The resulting subnetworks provide novel hypotheses for pathways involved in tumor progression. Although genes with known breast cancer mutations are typically not detected through analysis of differential expression, they play a central role in the protein network by interconnecting many differentially expressed genes. We find that the subnetwork markers are more reproducible than individual marker genes selected without network information, and that they achieve higher accuracy in the classification of metastatic versus non-metastatic tumors.},

@article{fDNN,
abstract = {In predictive model development, gene expression data is associated with the unique challenge that the number of samples (n) is much smaller than the amount of features (p). This “n ≪ p” property has prevented classification of gene expression data from deep learning techniques, which have been proved powerful under “n {\textgreater} p” scenarios in other application fields, such as image classification. Further, the sparsity of effective features with unknown correlation structures in gene expression profiles brings more challenges for classification tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose a newly developed classifier named Forest Deep Neural Network (fDNN), to integrate the deep neural network architecture with a supervised forest feature detector. Using this built-in feature detector, the method is able to learn sparse feature representations and feed the representations into a neural network to mitigate the overfitting problem. Simulation experiments and real data analyses using two RNA-seq expression datasets are conducted to evaluate fDNN's capability. The method is demonstrated a useful addition to current predictive models with better classification performance and more meaningful selected features compared to ordinary random forests and deep neural networks.},

abstract = {Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have markedly different treatment responses and overall outcome. The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70-80{\%} of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases ('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.},

abstract = {Breast cancer starts as a local disease, but it can metastasize to the lymph nodes and distant organs. At primary diagnosis, prognostic markers are used to assess whether the transition to systemic disease is likely to have occurred. The prevailing model of metastasis reflects this view--it suggests that metastatic capacity is a late, acquired event in tumorigenesis. Others have proposed the idea that breast cancer is intrinsically a systemic disease. New molecular technologies, such as DNA microarrays, support the idea that metastatic capacity might be an inherent feature of breast tumours. These data have important implications for prognosis prediction and our understanding of metastasis.},

@article{Metastasis2,
abstract = {Prognostic and predictive factors are indispensable tools in the treatment of patients with neoplastic disease. For the most part, such factors rely on a few specific cell surface, histological, or gross pathologic features. Gene expression assays have the potential to supplement what were previously a few distinct features with many thousands of features. We have developed Bayesian regression models that provide predictive capability based on gene expression data derived from DNA microarray analysis of a series of primary breast cancer samples. These patterns have the capacity to discriminate breast tumors on the basis of estrogen receptor status and also on the categorized lymph node status. Importantly, we assess the utility and validity of such models in predicting the status of tumors in crossvalidation determinations. The practical value of such approaches relies on the ability not only to assess relative probabilities of clinical outcomes for future samples but also to provide an honest assessment of the uncertainties associated with such predictive classifications on the basis of the selection of gene subsets for each validation analysis. This latter point is of critical importance in the ability to apply these methodologies to clinical assessment of tumor phenotype.},

@article{SPCAnew,
abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used tool for data analysis and dimension reduction in applications throughout science and engineering. However, the principal components (PCs) can sometimes be difficult to interpret, because they are linear combinations of all the original variables. To facilitate interpretation, sparse PCA produces modified PCs with sparse loadings, i.e. loadings with very few non-zero elements. In this paper, we propose a new sparse PCA method, namely sparse PCA via regularized SVD (sPCA-rSVD). We use the connection of PCA with singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix and extract the PCs through solving a low rank matrix approximation problem. Regularization penalties are introduced to the corresponding minimization problem to promote sparsity in PC loadings. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed for computation. Two tuning parameter selection methods are discussed. Some theoretical results are established to justify the use of sPCA-rSVD when only the data covariance matrix is available. In addition, we give a modified definition of variance explained by the sparse PCs. The sPCA-rSVD provides a uniform treatment of both classical multivariate data and high-dimension-low-sample-size (HDLSS) data. Further understanding of sPCA-rSVD and some existing alternatives is gained through simulation studies and real data examples, which suggests that sPCA-rSVD provides competitive results.},

@article{TumorClass2,
abstract = {The classification of different tumor types is of great importance in cancer diagnosis and drug discovery. However, most previous cancer classification studies are clinical based and have limited diagnostic ability. Cancer classification using gene expression data is known to contain the keys for addressing the fundamental problems relating to cancer diagnosis and drug discovery. The recent advent of DNA microarray technique has made simultaneous monitoring of thousands of gene expressions possible. With this abundance of gene expression data, researchers have started to explore the possibilities of cancer classification using gene expression data. Quite a number of methods have been proposed in recent years with promising results. But there are still a lot of issues which need to be addressed and understood. In order to gain a deep insight into the cancer classification problem, it is necessary to take a closer look at the problem, the proposed solutions and the related issues all together. In this survey paper, we present a comprehensive overview of various proposed cancer classification methods and evaluate them based on their computation time, classification accuracy and ability to reveal biologically meaningful gene information. We also introduce and evaluate various proposed gene selection methods which we believe should be an integral preprocessing step for cancer classification. In order to obtain a full picture of cancer classification, we also discuss several issues related to cancer classification, including the biological significance vs. statistical significance of a cancer classifier, the asymmetrical classification errors for cancer classifiers, and the gene contamination problem.},

@article{BreastCancerClassification,
abstract = {Comprehensive gene expression patterns generated from cDNA microarrays were correlated with detailed clinico-pathological characteristics and clinical outcome in an unselected group of 99 node-negative and node-positive breast cancer patients. Gene expression patterns were found to be strongly associated with estrogen receptor (ER) status and moderately associated with grade, but not associated with menopausal status, nodal status, or tumor size. Hierarchical cluster analysis segregated the tumors into two main groups based on their ER status, which correlated well with basal and luminal characteristics. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified 16 genes that were significantly associated with relapse-free survival at a stringent significance level of 0.001 to account for multiple comparisons. Of 231 genes previously reported by others [van't Veer, L. J., et al. (2002) Nature 415, 530-536] as being associated with survival, 93 probe elements overlapped with the set of 7,650 probe elements represented on the arrays used in this study. Hierarchical cluster analysis based on the set of 93 probe elements segregated our population into two distinct subgroups with different relapse-free survival (P {\textless} 0.03). The number of these 93 probe elements showing significant univariate association with relapse-free survival (P {\textless} 0.05) in the present study was 14, representing 11 unique genes. Genes involved in cell cycle, DNA replication, and chromosomal stability were consistently elevated in the various poor prognostic groups. In addition, glutathione S-transferase M3 emerged as an important survival marker in both studies. When taken together with other array studies, our results highlight the consistent biological and clinical associations with gene expression profiles.},

abstract = {Gene expression data are the representation of nonlinear interactions among genes and environmental factors. Computing analysis of these data is expected to gain knowledge of gene functions and disease mechanisms. Clustering is a classical exploratory technique of discovering similar expression patterns and function modules. However, gene expression data are usually of high dimensions and relatively small samples, which results in the main difficulty for the application of clustering algorithms. Principal component analysis (PCA) is usually used to reduce the data dimensions for further clustering analysis. While PCA estimates the similarity between expression profiles based on the Euclidean distance, which cannot reveal the nonlinear connections between genes. This paper uses nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NDR) as a preprocessing strategy for feature selection and visualization, and then applies clustering algorithms to the reduced feature spaces. In order to estimate the effectiveness of NDR for capturing biologically relevant structures, the comparative analysis between NDR and PCA is exploited to five real cancer expression datasets. Results show that NDR can perform better than PCA in visualization and clustering analysis of complex gene expression data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{dataOrigin,
abstract = {Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and has been classified into five molecular subtypes based on gene expression profiles. Signaling processes linked to different breast cancer molecular subtypes and different clinical outcomes are still poorly understood. Aberrant regulation of Wnt signaling has been implicated in breast cancer progression. In particular Ror1/2 receptors and several other members of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway were associated with aggressive breast cancer behavior. However, Wnt signals are mediated via multiple complex pathways, and it is clinically important to determine which particular Wnt cascades, including their domains and targets, are deregulated in poor prognosis breast cancer. To investigate activation and outcome of the Ror2-dependent non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, we overexpressed the Ror2 receptor in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells, stimulated the cells with its ligand Wnt5a, and we knocked-down Ror1 in MDA-MB231 cells. We measured the invasive capacity of perturbed cells to assess phenotypic changes, and mRNA was profiled to quantify gene expression changes. Differentially expressed genes were integrated into a literature-based non-canonical Wnt signaling network. The results were further used in the analysis of an independent dataset of breast cancer patients with metastasis-free survival annotation. Overexpression of the Ror2 receptor, stimulation with Wnt5a, as well as the combination of both perturbations enhanced invasiveness of MCF-7 cells. The expression-responsive targets of Ror2 overexpression in MCF-7 induced a Ror2/Wnt module of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway. These targets alter regulation of other pathways involved in cell remodeling processing and cell metabolism. Furthermore, the genes of the Ror2/Wnt module were assessed as a gene signature in patient gene expression data and showed an association with clinical outcome. In summary, results of this study indicate a role of a newly defined Ror2/Wnt module in breast cancer progression and present a link between Ror2 expression and increased cell invasiveness.},

@article{TumorClass3,
abstract = {Personalized drug design requires the classification of cancer patients as accurate as possible. With advances in genome sequencing and microarray technology, a large amount of gene expression data has been and will continuously be produced from various cancerous patients. Such cancer-alerted gene expression data allows us to classify tumors at the genomewide level. However, cancer-alerted gene expression datasets typically have much more number of genes (features) than that of samples (patients), which imposes a challenge for classification of tumors. In this paper, a new method is proposed for cancer diagnosis using gene expression data by casting the classification problem as finding sparse representations of test samples with respect to training samples. The sparse representation is computed by the l1 -regularized least square method. To investigate its performance, the proposed method is applied to six tumor gene expression datasets and compared with various support vector machine (SVM) methods. The experimental results have shown that the performance of the proposed method is comparable with or better than those of SVMs. In addition, the proposed method is more efficient than SVMs as it has no need of model selection.},
